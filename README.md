# TTRPG-Web-App
React-based Web App for Inventory Management of D&amp;D campaigns.

# Installation Instructions
1. Run `sudo apt update && sudo apt upgrade` if you haven't recently, to ensure all your system packages are up to date.
2. Run `sudo apt install nodejs` to actually install NodeJS. After that has finished, running `node -v` to verify that the installation was successful. That will list out the version of NodeJS that is installed. There is a minimum version requirement for the next command to work.
3. In the directory where you want to house your files, run `npx create-react-app my-app`. The `my-app` part will be the name of the directory that gets created, and will house all your project files.
4. Now that the folder for the React part of the project is set up, you can copy over all the files in the `src` folder of this project. THIS REPO DOES NOT CONTAIN THE FULL REACT DIRECTORY! You WILL have to create your own, then copy the supplied files into that folder. There are extra files that a React directory requires in order to function and build properly.
